                <p>These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access or use, from within Nigeria and its territories and
                    possessions of the applications, websites, content, products, and services (the “Services” as more fully
                    defined below in Section 3) made available in Nigeria and its territories and possessions by TUNSE
                    TECHNOLOGIES and its parents, subsidiaries, representatives, affiliates, officers and directors
                    (collectively, “TUNSE”). </p>
                <p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY, AS THEY CONSTITUTE A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU
                    AND TUNSE. In these terms, the words “including” and “include” mean “including, but not limited to.” </p>
                <p>By accessing or using the Services, you confirm your agreement to be bound by these Terms, which
                    establishes a contractual relationship between you and TUNSE. If you do not agree to these Terms, you
                    may not access or use the Services. These Terms expressly supersede prior agreements or arrangements
                    with you. TUNSE may immediately terminate these Terms or any Services with respect to you, or
                    generally, cease offering or deny access to the Services or any portion thereof, at any time for any
                    reason.</p>
                <p>IMPORTANT: PLEASE REVIEW THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT SET FORTH BELOW CAREFULLY, AS IT
                    WILL REQUIRE YOU TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH TUNSE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THROUGH FINAL
                    AND BINDING ARBITRATION. BY ENTERING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
                    YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND HAVE TAKEN TIME
                    TO CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS IMPORTANT DECISION.</p>
                <p>Supplemental terms may apply to certain Services, such as policies for a particular event, activity or
                    promotion, and such supplemental terms will be disclosed to you in connection with the applicable
                    Service(s). Supplemental terms are in addition to and shall be deemed a part of, the Terms for the
                    purposes of the applicable Service(s). Supplemental terms shall prevail over these Terms in the event of
                    a conflict with respect to the applicable Services.</p>
                <p>TUNSE may amend the Terms related to the Services from time to time. Amendments will be effective

                    supplemental terms on the applicable Service(s). Your continued access or use of the Services after such
                    posting confirms your consent to be bound by the Terms, as amended. If TUNSE changes these Terms
                    after the date you first agreed to the Terms (or to any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may

                    such change became effective, as indicated in the Effective date above. This written notice must be
                    provided either (a) by mail or hand delivery to our principal office for service of process, or (b) by email
                    from the email address associated with your account. In order to be effective, the notice must include

                    you are agreeing that you will continue to be bound by the provisions of these Terms as of the date you
                    first agreed to the Terms (or to any subsequent changes to these Terms). </p>

            <Section title="4. Payments & Billing">
                <p>You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for the services or goods
                    you receive from a T-worker (“Charges”). After you have received services or goods obtained
                    through your use of the platform, TUNSE will facilitate your payment of the applicable Charges
                    to the T-worker. Payment of the Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as
                    payment made directly by you to the T-worker. Charges may include other applicable fees, and
                    will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are final and
                    non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by TUNSE.
                </p>
                <p>All Charges are due immediately after the service is rendered and payment will be facilitated by
                    TUNSE using the preferred payment method designated in your Account, after which TUNSE
                    will send you a receipt by email. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be
                    expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that TUNSE may use a
                    secondary payment method in your Account, if available.
                </p>
                <p>As between you and TUNSE, TUNSE reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise
                    Charges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time in
                    TUNSE's sole discretion. Further, you acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in certain
                    geographical areas may increase substantially due to distance.
                </p>
                <p>You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity
                    to any T-worker who provides you with services or goods obtained through the platform, you
                    are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary. After you have received services or
                    goods obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and
                    leave additional feedback about the T-worker.
                </p>
                <p>Tunse uses a third-party payment processor, Paystack, to handle all payments between
                    customers, artisans (T-workers), and vendors. By using Tunse, you agree that all financial
                    transactions will be processed through Paystack, and you will be subject to their terms and
                    privacy policies.
                </p>
                <p>Tunse does not store or manage your card or bank account details directly. All transactions are
                    secured and encrypted by Paystack's infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p>Fees, commissions, or other applicable charges for services rendered or received will be clearly
                    displayed before you confirm a transaction. Upon successful payment, a receipt or confirmation
                    will be provided to the payer.
                </p>
                <p>Tunse reserves the right to update or change its pricing and fee model at any time. We will
                    make reasonable efforts to inform users of such changes in advance.
                </p>
                <strong>IMPORTANT: All T-workers and vendors are responsible for their own tax compliance. Tunse
                    only collects and remits taxes on its platform commissions in accordance with Nigerian law.

            <Section title="6. Arbitration Agreement">
                <p>By agreeing to the Terms, you agree that you are required to resolve any claim that you may
                    have against TUNSE on an individual basis in arbitration, as set forth in this Arbitration
                    Agreement. This will preclude you from bringing any class, collective, or representative action
                    against TUNSE, and also preclude you from participating in or recovering relief under any
                    current or future class, collective, consolidated, or representative action brought against
                    TUNSE by someone else.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Agreement to Binding Arbitration between You and TUNSE.</strong></p>
                <p>You and TUNSE agree that any dispute, Claim or controversy arising out of or relating to</p>
                <p>(a) these Terms or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity
                    thereof, or (b) your access to or use of the Services at any time, whether before or after the
                    date you agreed to the Terms, will be settled by binding arbitration between you and
                    TUNSE, and not in a court of law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where you allege claims
                    of sexual assault or sexual harassment occurring in connection with your use of the
                    Services, you may elect to bring those claims in a court of competent jurisdiction instead of
                    arbitration. TUNSE agrees to honor your election of forum with respect to your individual
                    sexual assault or sexual harassment claim but in so doing does not waive the enforceability
                    of this Arbitration Agreement as to any other provision (including, but not limited to, the
                    waivers provided in the following paragraph, which will continue to apply in court and
                    arbitration), controversy, claim or    dispute.
                    You acknowledge and agree that you and TUNSE are each waiving the right to a trial by the
                    Court or to participate as a plaintiff/claimant or class member in any purported class action
                    or representative proceeding. Unless both you and TUNSE otherwise agree in writing, any
                    arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective,
                    consolidated, or representative proceeding. However, you and TUNSE each retain the right
                    to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other
                    equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened
                    infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade
                    secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.</p>

                    modification or re-enactment thereof for the time being in force. The parties agree that the
                    arbitrator ("Arbitrator"), and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have
                    exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability,
                    enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or
                    any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be
                    responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to
                    whether the Terms are unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including
                    waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.
